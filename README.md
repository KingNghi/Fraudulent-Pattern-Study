# Project background
As digital payments become increasingly common, credit card fraud has emerged as a serious financial and data security problem.
While many institutions use machine learning models to detect fraud in real time, understanding the underlying behavioral patterns behind fraudulent activities is just as important.

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing fraud patterns using SQL, not predicting or flagging individual fraudulent transactions.
The goal is to understand how fraudulent behaviors differ from normal user behavior in terms of transaction frequency, timing, amount, and merchant characteristics.
# Data Structure & Initial Checks
The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, sourced from Kaggle.
